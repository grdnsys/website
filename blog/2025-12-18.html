<h1>The Xenoblade series and how it has shaped us</h1>
<p>A very personal runthrough of all the ways the Xenoblade games have shaped us as people.<br>
Written by: <a href="../people/vale.html">🦋 Vale (he/they/she)</a></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Content warnings:</b> All of this is kept somewhat vague, but I mention suicidality briefly, there are also some vague gestures at childhood trauma and abuse. In particular I talk about our experience with an overly controlling parent. This will also touch on our second hand experience with terminal illness briefly. 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So far a lot of the posts we have written on this site have been about plurality, this one will touch on this topic as well as it is hard to talk about anything personal without at least touching on it somewhat. But it will not be the focus.<br>
First a little bit about who I am as very few reading this will know me very well.<br>
My name is Vale, some know me as &quot;The Director&quot; which is a title I used instead of a name for a long time. I am not usually very social, but I catch a lot about what the others do and tend to puppeteer the others or push them into doing things I wish to see. This means that I have very few experiences that are entirely my own, in this case there is only ever one game I have played myself, but I will often sit over the shoulder of the others as they play certain games and influence them. So my experience with most games is some strange mix of watching a lets play and playing myself. This combined with my position in system means I very often know just as much about what the others in the system got out of an experience and what they were thinking.<br>
This is relevant for you to know as my experience with the Xenoblade franchise is far better described as our experience. I may be the one writing this and the one with the largest interest in this series of games but I am not alone and I will pull on experiences from the others while writing this text.</p>
<p><b>Note on spoilers:</b> I will try to avoid specific spoilers. But I will talk about some of the general themes of the games. Though I will leave a lot out and avoid giving enough away to ruin the experience for those who have not played them.<br>
I am also because of this leaving a lot of my thoughts on these games out as going into more detail would need me to go into spoilers.<br>
I may at some point in the future write more about these games, or if you have played them I will gladly talk about them more.</p>
<p>I will talk about these games in the order of release as that is the order I played them in. So first off:</p>
<h2>Xenoblade Chronicles 1</h2>
<p>What I say here is going to cover all three of the versions of the game. Though it may be interesting to note that the version of the game we played was the 3ds version.<br>
The world of the game is set on two giant titans who you as the player explore. Where the body of the titans make up everything you see. You start down on the foot of one of the titans, and slowly climb your way through the caves in the leg up to giant plains on the top of the thigh, then onward to other parts. The game opens on a cinematic where you see these two beings that make up the entire world fighting each-other before growing still. After this you see many many years into the future a war between the creatures from each of these titans. This conflict early on becomes the entire world, where you have the titan of biological life fighting the one made of machinery, and the creatures on the titans mirroring the very ground they walk on. The game very effectively makes you feel very small and that the conflict around you is much larger than you, and the conflict itself seems quite easy to understand.</p>
<p>In the tutorial of the game you are a great hero that wipes down entire armies with ease, but you see how normal people get slaughtered and have no chance. The game then takes that power away and gives you quite a weak character of the name Shulk. I remember the first time controlling Shulk, in the first hour of the game, finding myself feeling so small sitting there, in the shadow of the leg of the titan I walked on. A lot of games make you feel like the chosen one quite early, and while Xenoblade Chronicles 1 most definitely does that as well quite quickly, it starts you off feeling tiny. I absolutely adore the way the game makes you feels small, and even after you become the chosen one and classic JRPG protagonist, the game keeps occasionally knocking you down a peg, reminding you that this world and it's conflicts are old, and there is so much happening that is above your head.<br>
There are times through the game where I felt my understanding of even quite basic things in the game takes the very ground under you and shakes it up.</p>
<p>I am not someone who enjoys a twist in a story just for the sake of it, I often find plot twists and such to be deeply unnecessary in a lot of stories and often they just frustrates me.<br>
But the ones in Xenoblade Chronicles 1 somehow manage to work perfectly with this feeling of being small and for me ended up being an incredible reminder that while you are the all powerful protagonist the world also exists outside of you. This is a lesson that when I was 15-16 years old and discovered the game I think I sorely needed.<br>
As can be said about a lot of 15-16 year old kids we were a pain, and very often thought we the world figured out. This is a trap some of us fall into as adults as well. But this ended up being a bit of a wake up call for several of us. We thought we knew how the world worked and how it should work at the time, and looking back on this now is almost painful because we were so very wrong about almost everything. This is something I started to realise was the case when I was younger looking at this game. Seeing how small I was in this game even as the protagonist, made me think about our life where we are far from any protagonist, and we still thought we knew everything.<br>
It made us rethink a lot of our stances on the world and people around us, and in the long term led to adopting a much better view on most things. While I do think this would have happened eventually anyways I still feel the need to credit this game with making us soften up our worldviews a lot and this has left lasting marks in us as people.</p>
<p>A core game mechanic and story element is the ability to occasionally see the future. This future then be changed if you find a way to do so.<br>
This evolves into a larger idea that despite the scale of things and you feeling quite small that you should be the one in charge of your own fate. You get a lot of examples of this not being the case, but the game sets this up as an aspiration, this is also a strong theme in all of the later games as well. Everyone deserves self determination and control over the direction of their own life.<br>
The idea that it is nice to steer your own life may be somewhat obvious to some. But we found this game as a child, generally speaking kids are not known for having large amounts of control over their own life. With us this was somewhat especially the case growing up with an overprotective and quite controlling mother. A lot of decisions in our life be they big like what school we should go to and who our friends should be, to personal things like what our hair looked like and what we should draw was decided for us. For a long time we put up with this, as it was normal for us. It was seen as a given that we would not have control over much of anything. <br>
Finding this game and having it beat over my head that &quot;the future is ours to decide&quot; is one of the reasons we eventually managed to gather what we needed to resist this control and to for example not take the career path our mother wanted but the one we wished for instead. This eventually led to us largely managing to stop her control. Had we not found this game when we did we would have gone down an entirely different career path, an entirely different school, made different friends, and ultimately not ended up very happy I suspect as I think we wouldn't do very well in the field our mother tried to push us into. It is impossible to understate the impact this had on us and how happy I am that we thought about this when we did.</p>
<p>To get a bit away from personal experiences and ways this changed us for a moment because I have a sidenote I wish to touch on.<br>
One of the first characters the game establishes is Reyn who is quickly shown to have muscles for brains. Having the smart crafty protagonist and his meathead friend is somewhat cliche in a lot of ways. But it is notable in how real it feels in this game. This somewhat mirrored the dynamic between us and a friend of ours at the time in a lot of ways, and the dynamic displayed in the game feels less like watching characters and more like you are watching two actual friends. Early on it feels a bit cliche but as you go on every single character introduced ends up feeling like this, like full people in a lot of ways.<br>
There is a character established later on as almost entirely comic relief and I remember seeing them and absolutely despising their guts. But if you do the more character focused parts of the game, you find out they are the one of the most mature characters out of the group. Despite not actually being human they end up feeling incredibly human with a remarkable level of complexity. The characters all feel this human, I would give more examples, but a lot of these characters are hard for me to describe in few words and in a way I find satisfying. But I have never found another game where the characters and their relationships feel as human as this one, and many of these characters and their relationships feel like they closely mirror a lot of our own experiences with people.<br>
This also goes for a lot of the villains, though in that department there are some that feel far more real than others and I can't go into detail here without getting far more specific than I want to.</p>
<p>I have more I can say about the first game.<br>
I can speak about this one for hours and hours, a lot of what I said here is quite general, and I have far more to say about a lot of this. But for the sake of not writing a book I will cut myself off somewhat here. I will also say that what I said about the character writing in particular comes with a lot of qualifiers and a lot more nuance but I can go on about this forever and have to cut myself off somewhere, and there is only so much I can say without spoiling anything.</p>
<h2>Xenoblade Chronicles X</h2>
<p>I will keep this very short. Most of what I am writing about here is about story. This is not X's strong suit.<br>
Out of all the games this is the one I personally enjoy the process of playing the most and it has consumed close to 700 hours of my life at the time of writing and I still play it fairly often and I likely always will. I mentioned in the introduction to this that I generally hover over others when playing games instead of playing myself.<br>
This is and has always been the exception, this is a game that despite the weaker story was for a long time my singular reason for fronting and I hold a great deal of love for it. This game has served as a wonderful distraction from how terrible the world can be. It has pulled me through a lot of things, as it is a game I return to during hard times especially. And I highly recommend anyone play it especially if you have played the first game and enjoyed the combat of that. It is a brilliant game that I think is worth trying, if you have the time for it.</p>
<h2>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</h2>
<p>This is an interesting game to talk about. It found us right right before it became common knowledge in our system that we were one. When we found this I was actively trying to suppress this discovery, due to this we largely didn't get much from this game on our initial play-through, though I personally still did. For most of us it became nothing more than dumb fun.<br>
Then we played the game again when I wasn't actively trying to make the entire system discard half the things from the game and it hit very differently.</p>
<p>While a lot of the Xenoblade series have things in them which can be read through a plural lens in interesting ways the second game is the one where this is the easiest to do. The game practically shoves the concept of plurality down your throat with the characters of Pyra and Mythra. This made getting anything out of the game initially hard. Looking too deeply into any part of the game meant actually seeing Pyra and Mythra for what they are as well, so I did everything I could to make sure we didn't think about it too much.</p>
<p>On our second play-through of the game our plurality was undeniable anymore. It went from being something select people in our system knew about without having the words to explain to something well known that we were in the process of informing others in our life about.<br>
This made Pyra and Mythra as characters hit much differently. This game is possibly my favourite media representation of plurality. Full stop. The game does not exactly explore it directly as much as is possible, but it is highly relevant regardless.<br>
The game also touches a lot on themes which especially a lot of trans people find relatable. There are characters in the game that you can very easily look at through a trans lens. Particularly the game touches a lot on self acceptance and not hiding who you are.</p>
<p>We played this game the first time right after coming out to a lot of people and you would think this might have hit, but due to not thinking about the game at all it actually had very little effect on us then. These themes are one of the reasons I got more comfortable myself with the idea of being known and why I am now doing such personal things as writing this very post.<br>
The themes of self acceptance and showing off to the world who one is combined with the exploration of plurality merged into one in our mind as well and has become one of the reasons we are as loud about our plurality as we are today. This is the reason why we do not just tell people we are plural and shrug when they elect to ignore it but instead will shout at people who refuse to see us for what we are.</p>
<p>This was probably the most major way the game has affected us, but there is one more thing I wish to note that has hit several of us.<br>
I will try to stay somewhat vague while talking about this. But this game handles trauma, and particularly suicidality in a way that hit us incredibly hard. It mirrors some of the experiences of myself and others in my system in a lot of ways. Particularly in the way it is hidden and expressed.<br>
The game is quite lighthearted on the surface, but handles a fair few darker themes, and it does this really really well. This is all I will say. Partially to avoid spoilers, partially to avoid getting too dark and potentially triggering, and partially because details about my own experience on this particular matter isn't something I wish to put on a public blog.</p>
<p>I mentioned in passing that I still got something from the first play-through.<br>
The blades of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 are fully fledged people, but when the person wielding them dies they return to a dormant state and lose their memories. The game uses this and somewhat explores the effect your memories have on who you are. Asking questions about if you are still you if you lose your memories.</p>
<p>I do memory allocation and control for our system. I have at least some control over who remembers what, and I have many times decided to pull and bury memories from others, or shuffle memories around so the memories are held by another instead of the person who experienced it. Seeing this game made me think about this a lot, and thinking about it made me do this a whole lot less. I do still do this even to this day when it is needed. But spending a lot of time thinking about this is one of the reasons I stopped interfering with the others discovering our systemhood.<br>
I largely did this by either taking memories where it was clear or giving enough memories to whoever was around to make them not notice the gaps. By letting the others keep their memories it allowed our syscovery to happen, and it allowed them to develop as their own people instead of getting mixed together by me messing with their memories.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is therefore not just the game that outright represents plurality unlike a lot of other media, but may be one of the reasons us being plural was ever discovered, and it is undeniably the reason we are so confident in expressing it. This is also one of the very few bits of media we have ever got a clear introject from.</p>
<h2>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</h2>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is possibly the game that wears how dark it is the most clearly on it's sleeve. While for example 2 touches on some fairly dark subject matter it is always not far off from a joke.<br>
Xenoblade Chronicles 3's world is an absolutely miserable place in a lot of ways, it is a world of constant war and death. But at the same time it has the same quality that the 1st game has where the characters feel very real, in a way that was somewhat missing from the 2nd game. The group of 6 protagonists end up managing to laugh about things the same way that we do even in miserable situations, and the way they go from wanting to kill each-other to joking with each-other mirrors some of the closest relationships that some of the people in our system has today. I can make many observations about some of the people in our system and how they talk with each-other and those close to us, and it can fit just as well into descriptions of relationships in this game. Even more so than the first game which I also praised for this.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes the themes of the first two games and builds on them even more, it takes the questions from the 2nd game about memories for example and builds on those, and it takes the themes of self determination from the first game as well.<br>
The game to a large degree feels like it is wrapping up what the first two games built, and to me playing it has made me look back at the effect the last two games had on me, in a way this post partially comes from this retrospection.</p>
<p>The game has some unique things to say however, this game stands on its own in every way very well.<br>
This absolutely miserable world has some very real feeling effects on the characters. You can feel how they grapple with death and it made us do the same. This ended up helping us a lot, as not far after we finished this games story we had to grapple with someone very close to us potentially being terminally ill. The ways a lot of us handled this differs from person to person so it is hard to speak about in broad strokes, but at least personally it helped me handle that a lot, and I am probably going to end up replaying the game again in the future as I think now with that experience that I will get even more from it.</p>
<p>The game also ended up making me reflect a lot on our childhood, in the game almost every single character was never allowed to have a childhood as everyone becomes a soldier pretty much right after birth. This resonates a lot as someone who is to a large degree a product of having to be an adult far too early and losing much of my early life to trauma. It has made me no less resentful that my youth was robbed from me. But I used to think that if I could change my past that I would, this has helped change my mind. While I would never wish what we have been through on anyone else, I also can see that I am a product of said things, and I am far too happy with the person I am today and the place we are in today to wish to change anything.</p>
<p>This part about Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is much shorter than the others, but we have played the other games several times. I have not got around to doing this with the 3rd game yet, I suspect that I will have even more things to say about it after a 2nd play-through and even more time to think about it.<br>
One more thing however: Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is one of the very few games that we have had to take a break from to go cry.<br>
It is an incredible experience unlike anything else.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This started as a few thoughts I had about games as an art-form and the way that games can shape who you are as a person. Then it evolved into this as I kept thinking about it and kept coming back to Xenoblade. There are many other games that have shaped who we are as a collective, and many that have shaped who individual people in our system are. But this is the series of games that have had the most profound impact on me, and it has made me love these games more than most pieces of media. I know some of the others can talk about how Team Fortress 2 for example has shaped some of us.</p>
<p>I have seen those in my system who make a habit out of speaking to people talk with others where those others have made statements about games just being entertainment. This bothers me a lot when I see it as I think there is a lot of artistic value here. Games are far from just entertainment and I think you lose a lot not looking at them more deeply. Even games that are on the surface just dumb fun can have a lot more to say, and can have profound impacts on people.<br>
A good way of expressing this I thought was to get quite personal about it.<br>
The way these things impact people will also differ, not everyone will relate to the way the 2nd Xenoblade game handles suicide. I also have plural readings of all of these games which I know I do not share with everyone, but I think it can be valuable to talk about even very personal readings of media.</p>
<p>I hope you have come out of this wanting to play these games if you have not already. I wrote this partially hoping to get to share something I deeply appreciate with the ones around me.<br>
If you have played the games before and this made you want to replay them to read more into them: Godspeed my friend, see you in a few hundred hours.</p>
