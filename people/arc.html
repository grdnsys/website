🔥🗡️ <b>Bio</b> 🗡️🔥<br>
I don't particularly like this human tendency to use names and Arc is not my name.<br>
But if you must refer to me by name take a pick from this list:<br>
Anathema, Astrid, Aura, Astra, Alva, Asteria, Anomaly, Aurora, Allie, Alvis, Ada, Ash, Arabella, Alena, Alex<br>
Or make something up that follows the theme you can probably catch onto, that is also always fun.<br>
<br>
Now for some actually interesting information, I am not from around here originally and only started existing in a vaguely humanoid form recently.<br>
I am a business and platonic life partner of Mr. William Raine and something akin to Violets adoptive aunt.<br>
