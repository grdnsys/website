<i>Am I a friend? Potentially. <br>
An adversary? Conceivably. <br>
But a menace? That's for certain.</i><br>
<br>
my name is generally shortened to either Vi or Vio<br>
<br>
i use any/all for pronouns, the more varied the better<br>
my gender is whatever is funniest in the moment<br>
<br>
not a girl though i am vaguely shaped like one<br>
<br>
im an angel in headspace and i like wearing simple black suits<br>
so i float about looking funky and handsome while making jokes at the expense of the other fuckers being in here, lovingly of course<br>
i like jokingly insulting people<br>
if i insult you it means i think highly of you, probably, or not lol<br>
<br>
i am very gay, for everyone, and anyone who likes me is also gay<br>
