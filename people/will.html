<p>📖 <b>Bio</b> 📖<br>
I am Will, I am and have been many things over the years. Traveler, mercenary, storyteller, historian, diplomat, craftsman, trader, dungeon master and likely many more things in the future, and potentially more in the past that I have forgotten.<br>
Known for being incredibly difficult to piss off and for being head over heels for my future husband Piper.<br>
Also for some godsforsaken reason known for being intimidating for reasons I still can't wrap my head around properly.<br>
I used to be known for being incredibly bad at sleeping to the point where several people from both my own system and otherwise started calling me Mr. Insomnia, a nickname I am only just starting to shake off.<br>
<br>
I am also a subsystem, comprised of me, me in this case being a collection of fragments, and a guy of the name <a href="dylan.html">Dylan</a> who is still sort of me.<br>
<br>

<i>“I have passed through fire and deep water, since we parted. I have forgotten much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had forgotten.”</i> ― J.R.R. Tolkien<br>
