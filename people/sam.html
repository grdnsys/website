🎭 <b>Bio</b> 🎭<br>
I am Sam, the chameleon, shapeshifter and actor.<br>
You already have talked to me more than you think as I have been impersonating others in the system for a while now and will continue doing so.<br>
Though if I don't trust you don't expect me to actually introduce myself if I am around, I am way more likely to just stick to the role of the person who was there before me.<br>
If you have a problem with that then you can contact <a href="./rose">Rose</a> for kneecap removal.<br>
<br>
Treat me normally and I will probably show up and chat occasionally though.<br>
