<p>📗 <b>Bio</b> 📗<br>
I'm Dylan or also just Will, I'm both him and at the same time the book he carries around.<br>
I tried to steal his soul and instead merged with him, as one does. Now I vibe in his pocket taking the form of him in his teens.<br>
Me and Will prime are fairly alike in a fair amount of ways and we can safely be considered the same person.
I also really love this dumbass named Piper. He needs to be mentioned in my bio too. 🩵<br>
<br>
I'm a part of a subsystem with <a href="will.html">old man Will</a> who as mentioned is still sort of me.<br>
